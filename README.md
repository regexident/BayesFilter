# BayesFilter

> A Bayes filter is an algorithm used in computer science for calculating the probabilities of multiple beliefs  
> to allow a robot to infer its position and orientation.
> 
> Essentially, Bayes filters allow robots to continuously update their most likely position within a coordinate system,  
> based on the most recently acquired sensor data. This is a recursive algorithm.
> 
>  It consists of two parts: prediction and innovation.
